# Logistic-Regression
The MortgageDefaulters.xls contains data on mortgages that have been approved by bank
underwriters. The goal is to predict which of future such approved mortgages will default. The purpose
of this prediction is not to alter the underwriting standards, but rather to assess the need for and cost
of secondary insurance on mortgages.
